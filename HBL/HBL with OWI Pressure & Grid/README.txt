The grid and pressure data in these files comes from OWI. The wind data comes from HBL and is interpolated to the OWI grid. No temporal interpolation was necessary because there exists HBL data for every OWI time slice. HBL has a 1-minute temporal resolution and OWI has a 15-minute temporal resolution.
